# Contribution guidelines

Please create an issue to collect feedback prior to feature additions. If possible try to keep PRs scoped to one feature, and add tests for new features. We use the fork-based contribution model described by [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project). (In short: Fork the TruffleHog repo and open a PR back from your fork into our default branch.)

When showing interest in a bug, enhancement, PR, or issue, please use the thumbs up/thumbs down emoji on the original message rather than adding comments expressing the same.

Contributors need to [sign our CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) before we are able to accept contributions.
